            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br> industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br> scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release <br> of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br> software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical <br> Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at <br> Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from <br> a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the <br> undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The <br> Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very <br> popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from <br> a line in section</p>
